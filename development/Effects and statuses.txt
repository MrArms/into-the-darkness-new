Statuses happen on actors (currently) at the end of the turn. They create actions and gameEvents and word with the ActionGod.
Currently they cannot affect attack/defence/evasion etc..

Effects are applied during the turns and affect attack/defence/evasion etc. but they don't directly create Actions or gameEvents.
Whenever the state of the game changes the effects are reapplied to each actor.
They CURRENTLY only last one turn - but this may change for monster innate effects like vulnerability and weaken.
The timer is reduced at the start of each turn rather than the end.

Charms have one or more effect associated with them
Charms that are selected add to the players this._tempCharmEffects array and all the actors
This is copied to the this._charmEffects at the end of their turn

We could make both sets deplete the timer at the start rather than the end of the turn, but will leave it how it is for now.
