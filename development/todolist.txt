====== UI Stuff ========


NEED TO ARRANGE THE CHARMS IN TWO COLOMNS FOR THE MOMENT
	Need to use _getCharmIndexFromCell in UI for the display and mouse selection of charms (and check mouse over code too)

Need to remove charms once they have been used by the player. DONE

Add load/save of inventory DONE

Will need a scrolling interface I think for the charms - not sure about this.... perhaps leave UI design for later on and get the game going more now


Need an inventory that contains charms - do we want monsters to have player type inventories? Could make it actor based so could add further party members later for another game....
	No because a party roguelike will probably share inventories
Need an interface for displaying charms and selecting them (and with calls to update the character)

MONSTERS will have an inventory too - the same as the player? Or a simpler monster inventory?
	Making it the same would probably improve the code - and can give monsters charms and items easier
		Although monsters already can have innate skills and we don't want them to be able to use charms anyway
		
	Can just give them a simple inventory that has charms and items - nothing to do with the player inventory (it doesn't need the same functionality anyway)

				
Inventory and UI need to work with load/save game				
				
=== Need to show character symbols and colours =====

A colour class might be good, because it holds each shade which you can get and also the colour and text versions of each part				
				
======= Knockback and counter attack ========

Then need to implement knockback (and double blow) with damage and see if it all holds up


====== Level Generation ======

When we do level generation, want to create a series of level seeds and send them to the levels when they are generated
		Also want to save previous monsters (especially uniques), towns, treasures and drops from previous level creation to make sure we have variety in the levels
			The game uses random seed AND the previous level data to create a new level
Could save the level seeds at the start
Also could use that seed to generate contents for chests and drops for monsters when they are created.




THINK ABOUT SECURITY!!!
