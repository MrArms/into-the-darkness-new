
Fix revenge charm - DONE

Get maximum of all defence values adjacent to you  DONE
	Could temporarily store all actors adjacent to the actor (and later all those in line of sight)
		pros - can easily update values for the actor
		cons - don't like storing pointers to other actors
		conclusion - don't bovver - just create variables for each possible thing you need and use them


Don't really want to do this just yet, brain isn't working quite right :/
Move _turnActionFinished and _turnFinished from Level to actor (or tidy it up properly)

In Attack we really need the same logic applied to both attacker and defender when damaged/healed

Need to decide how we want attack patterns to work - do they stack etc.? DONE FOR NOW
	Need a brief design of ranged + surround etc.
		Surround = each surrounding cell
		Ranged + surround = target + each surrounding cell

Change double move to record the controls? That way you can move then attack etc. - would cause complications with effect length, charms selected etc. PROBABLY BEST TO LEAVE FOR NOW

Make a list of everything that is needed for version 0.2 and then work your way through it all (with deadlines etc.)


====== Basic stats ====

Add strength
Magic
Wisdom
Will 

Strength - each point adds one point of damage 

Constitution - difficult one this, perhaps it is only valid for the player since we want to set monster HP explicitly.
	Could just have Constitution = number of HP - yes do this for now KEEPING AS _maxHP FOR THE MOMENT!!!

Calculated stats
	
NEED TO ADD ALL NEW STATS TO THE LOAD/SAVE STUFF ***********

Defence

Picking stuff up takes a turn? LEAVE FOR THE MOMENT


Things we need before we have a game

-- Loads more charm types
-- Loads more monster types
-- Monsters spawning
-- Equipment you can wield
-- Objects on floor (not just charms)
-- Magic ranged attacks
