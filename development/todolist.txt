Actors not being removed after being killed FIXED

Need to create an animation system that waits for gameEvents a different amount of time depending on what they are 
	(it also wait for the longest one to finish)
		Perhaps it should use frames rather than a TweenMax delay


Need a function for determining the actors that get hit by an attack DONE (although only for the normal single cell attack) DONE


	
Want to improve the animation system and give them timings that can last different lengths of time (eg. movement is faster than say an attack)
	Then need to test the actors to see if all the animations have finished
Also perhaps need an array of GameEvents possible on an actor rather than just one	
Then need to implement knockback with damage and see if it all holds up
	
Need to create an action and gameEvent here somehow	for movement (remember all that shit?)

Add attacking monsters (also need to add to them an alignment in case we want to add friendly units or tribes)
	

PUSH IT FIRST THING WHEN FINISHED THE ABOVE!!!!!!!
Review level logic in Game.js - should it be moved to the level? Think of the role of each class
Should CellDataObject.getData() stuff be simplified to be easier to use?

2) Get the actors data from the GameConstants again
3) Get monsters moving around the map too (using pathfinding as before)
4) Check in
5) Implement attacking monsters and them attacking you

Create screen manager, menu, game over and instruction screens and send the game controls to each one (like before)
	Also think about whether we want 1 renderer or one for each screen
		SHOULD INSTRUCTIONS EVEN BE A SCREEN? Need them in game too? Or separate help system?




THINK ABOUT SAVING/LOADING, RECORDING and REPLAYING THE GAME TURNS - find out how brogue does it


Convert the level._actors array into a CellDataObject DONE
	It will be easier to render and compare positions for calculations etc. DONE




Put the los functions in the map and update the viewed cells in there - send it the position of the player
	Renderer should just grab the map and render it

Put free cell functions (ie positioning monsters etc.) in map? Or level?

(think about saving/loading and recording before doing this)


What is next? The map and moving about? Camera? These two first.
