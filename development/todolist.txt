Regain - get back health from previous turn if you aren't damaged this turn
Payback - damage attackers as they damage you.
Adrenelin - keep getting free turns for each turn you kill a monster (just don't reduce the move timer or the adrenaline timer)	DONE									
	Also would be good to build up monsters killed this "turn" so they don't reset
		Will need to show the ADRENALINE effect on the HUD in that case as it can continue several turns
			Can you use other cards in the meantime?
			
Poison - how does this work again?

====== Level Generation ======

When we do level generation, want to create a series of level seeds and send them to the levels when they are generated
		Also want to save previous monsters (especially uniques), towns, treasures and drops from previous level creation to make sure we have variety in the levels
			The game uses random seed AND the previous level data to create a new level
Could save the level seeds at the start
Also could use that seed to generate contents for chests and drops for monsters when they are created.




THINK ABOUT SECURITY!!!
