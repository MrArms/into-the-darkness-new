
==== Tidy up ======

Need animations that work on more than one tiles

Need to unify names for gameEvent, actions and animations - also a faster way of creating them would be good

Possibly need the ability to "play" two or more actions at the same time
	Then will not need multiple targets in particular actions 
		THAT IS WHAT THE GameEvents are for in the first place, playing multiple animations at the same time
			Just make an Action create more GameEvents if you want more animations at the same time
			
Could do with a MULTIPLE DEATH animation for all the dead actors in that moment
	Then it won't look so annoying when you kill multiple monsters in one go
		Add all the deaths up in ActionGod._resolveAction and then send the gameEvent an array rather than a singular things
		
HOW'S ABOUT
	GameEvents just take multiple animations on multiple actors - that way damage and death can happen together?
		Would need to redo how DEATH actions are created however - I don't mind them getting attacked and then dying
			Or create a DAMAGE_DEATH gameEvent instead of having them separate
			
We will need an overview thingy to combine multiple gameEvents that take up more than one tile
	
Create and TEST multiple hits (whirlwind attack for the moment)

Need to rename MOVE_WAIT to something more appropriate


Need to work out when actors die - calculate in Attack?

Need a death animation regardless of how the actor dies (could be an attack, status effect etc.)
	The gameEvent needs to tell the ActionGod a new Death action has been created. NAH
	
Could add on xp ups to the player where relevant



	
When you create the damage event also add a death action to the ActionGod.
	Same with status effects (will need to test this out afterwards)
	
This is better because all the actions get created automatically 
	Want the gameEvent that causes damage to also create a DEATH action if necessary
		Also adds to the number of actors the player has killed this turn (if it isn't the player)
		
THE LEVEL CAN CREATE THE DEATH ACTIONS! No that's bad too as if you kill an actor and then continue your turn the dead actor will still be sitting there
	PUT IT IN THE ACTION GOD

Problem is that GameEvents and Actors are dumb regarding the ActionGod currently		
		

Need dying animation
	Create an action? Or a gameEvent?
		An action I think.
Need status "contracted" animation


Melee animation 


Add some more charms with effects
Get poison working again - FIND OUT HOW IT WORKED BEFORE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

	Here's how it was done before
		_actor.addStatus(Status.POISON, 3);
		
	Maybe need a create status effect or action? The timing might be quite tricky however
		Perhaps actors can have multiple effects rather than just one and they take different lengths of time
			Or even one after the other
				So an actor that is hit and then shows that they are poisoned
		
		Or perhaps keep it simple and combine the two somehow			Hit + paralysis
			Hit + poison etc.
			
	Need to think about ranged effects and animations that span multiple tiles too :/
		The renderer can grab an actor but still render multiple tiles at once
		
	Need to keep going backwards and forwards with the animation making it look good
	
	I think a separate action for causing status effects might be good
	Also an animation for death too
	
	Also getting the lighting in might be good - for now just a general ambient light and light surrounding the player (and perhaps some monsters)
	
	
	Need an animation class that has timer, char, foreground colour and background colour values that change over time
	Then need something to control all the animations - the renderer grabs the animations
		Perhaps a gameEvent could be this? It has an update function that gets updated every frame (not by the renderer itself)
			The actionGod could update all the gameEvents and also check that they are finished before continuing
	
	Change it so the wait at the end is just part of the animation?
	
	The end turn wait is done twice currently, once in the actionGod and once in the Level afterwards
	
Melee animation - 

BUG currently still counters twice with double_move and counter_attack even if the defender dies on the first counter FIXED

Should possibly think about an animation pass - get things working and remember how stuff you've written works
	Get some cool animations going - write up how it all works
		Need to get the visuals going as we go along to avoid massive rewrites later on

Think about animations and how we will want to implement them from where we are
	Will probably do them in terms of frames - so 10 frames of this colour/char combo then 15 of this etc.
		Could change the frame rate to the same as the animation? Might make moving annoying
	Could make an animation "frame" 10 normal frames or something


Poison - how does this work again? Added poison charm/effect, but it isn't implemented yet - need an animation for actually getting poisoned? Is it a separate action?
	Could just keep it simple for now I guess
	Make the attack itself poison green showing it has poisoned the defender - create a POISON_ATTACK action and that can be animated differently
	
Let's make some interesting animations for what we've got
	Attack
	Death	
	Poison attack - could be two stage so normal damage and then a green * or something showing that they are poisoned
	The "Add status" could be an ACTION 
	Poison status damage

====== Level Generation ======

When we do level generation, want to create a series of level seeds and send them to the levels when they are generated
		Also want to save previous monsters (especially uniques), towns, treasures and drops from previous level creation to make sure we have variety in the levels
			The game uses random seed AND the previous level data to create a new level
Could save the level seeds at the start
Also could use that seed to generate contents for chests and drops for monsters when they are created.




THINK ABOUT SECURITY!!!
