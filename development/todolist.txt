Create _data object for Game and Level too so when we add more variables they automatically get saved and restored properly
Apply to status and effects objects too

===== Add folders for different parts of the game ====

Design which ones here first before you do anything

Game				
	Inventory	
	Renderer			
	GameGlobals
	UI
		
	Level
		Status
		CharmGlobals
		LevelMap
		TurnManager
		AI
		ActionGod
		Actor
		Attack
		Level
		GameEvent
		Game
		CellDataObject
		Effect
	
Others
	Main
	Globals
	Utils

==== Adding screen manager and other screens ====

Copy from previous project - but I don't want signals anymore as they are shite
Pass the keyboard and mouse handling to the current screen to be processed

==== Player dying =====

Need to wait until the full turn is over and then test for player death (when removing dead actors probably)
Then set the level to inactive (leave level maybe?) then tell the game screen you've died

======= Knockback and counter attack ========

Then need to implement knockback with damage and see if it all holds up




====== Level Generation ======

When we do level generation, want to create a series of level seeds and send them to the levels when they are generated
		Also want to save previous monsters (especially uniques), towns, treasures and drops from previous level creation to make sure we have variety in the levels
			The game uses random seed AND the previous level data to create a new level
Could save the level seeds at the start
Also could use that seed to generate contents for chests and drops for monsters when they are created.




THINK ABOUT SECURITY!!!
