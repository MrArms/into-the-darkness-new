==== Tidy up ======

Sort out actionGod, perhaps certain things can be moved to the Attack class DO THIS FIRST DONE

Think about animations and how we will want to implement them from where we are
	Will probably do them in terms of frames - so 10 frames of this colour/char combo then 15 of this etc.
		Could change the frame rate to the same as the animation? Might make moving annoying
	Could make an animation "frame" 10 normal frames or something


Poison - how does this work again? Added poison charm/effect, but it isn't implemented yet - need an animation for actually getting poisoned? Is it a separate action?
	Could just keep it simple for now I guess
	Make the attack itself poison green showing it has poisoned the defender - create a POISON_ATTACK action and that can be animated differently
	
Let's make some interesting animations for what we've got
	Attack
	Death	
	Poison attack - could be two stage so normal damage and then a green * or something showing that they are poisoned
	The "Add status" could be an ACTION 
	Poison status damage

====== Level Generation ======

When we do level generation, want to create a series of level seeds and send them to the levels when they are generated
		Also want to save previous monsters (especially uniques), towns, treasures and drops from previous level creation to make sure we have variety in the levels
			The game uses random seed AND the previous level data to create a new level
Could save the level seeds at the start
Also could use that seed to generate contents for chests and drops for monsters when they are created.




THINK ABOUT SECURITY!!!
