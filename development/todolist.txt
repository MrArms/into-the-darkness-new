Levels? Need all nice neat logic for this 
	
	LEVEL is DUMB all game logic goes in Game.js
	
CURRENTLY DOING level and map stuff (and camera stuff)

I want just the player wandering around the map

Put the los functions in the map and update the viewed cells in there - send it the position of the player
	Renderer should just grab the map and render it

Put free cell functions (ie positioning monsters etc.) in map? Or level?

(think about saving/loading and recording before doing this)


What is next? The map and moving about? Camera? These two first.







COMMIT AND PUSH YOUR CHANGES TO GITHUB!!!!

THINK ABOUT SAVING/LOADING, RECORDING and REPLAYING THE GAME TURNS 

THINK ABOUT SECURITY!!!
