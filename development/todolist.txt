====== UI Stuff ========


Need to figure out where this goes in relation to GameScreen and Level _resetCharms
	(currently in GameScreen, but probably should go in Level? - Could pass the inventory through? Dunno needs thinking about. Maybe just the selected charms.) 
	
Two choices
	1) Have a callback in the level telling the GameScreen a new turn has started (and whether it is the player's turn or not) DONE
	
Change so instead of the callbacks, the level just calls the appropriate function in game? DONE
	
Possible to cheat by saving after selecting charms and then reloading with the bonuses, but without the charms selected? SEEMS OK

Create an inventory with a list of charms and the number of each
Then create a way of displaying it (in renderer or a separate UI class?)

Knockback 2
Bloodlust 1
Charm A   3
Charm B   1
etc.


Do we want Angband type slots with a maximum number of a particular type of charm? Or just a maximum number of charms altogether
	Slots reduces choices somewhat in that you have to have a certain number of each type of charm to make it worthwhile to use a slots
		Also there is a jarring moment when you have to toss a whole stack of something that would probably be useful
			Also makes rare charms not worth keeping
			
Will need a scrolling interface I think for the charms 


Need an inventory that contains charms - do we want monsters to have player type inventories? Could make it actor based so could add further party members later for another game....
	No because a party roguelike will probably share inventories
Need an interface for displaying charms and selecting them (and with calls to update the character)

MONSTERS will have an inventory too - the same as the player? Or a simpler monster inventory?
	Making it the same would probably improve the code - and can give monsters charms and items easier
		Although monsters already can have innate skills and we don't want them to be able to use charms anyway
		
	Can just give them a simple inventory that has charms and items - nothing to do with the player inventory (it doesn't need the same functionality anyway)

				
Inventory and UI need to work with load/save game				
				
=== Need to show character symbols and colours =====

A colour class might be good, because it holds each shade which you can get and also the colour and text versions of each part				
				
======= Knockback and counter attack ========

Then need to implement knockback (and double blow) with damage and see if it all holds up


====== Level Generation ======

When we do level generation, want to create a series of level seeds and send them to the levels when they are generated
		Also want to save previous monsters (especially uniques), towns, treasures and drops from previous level creation to make sure we have variety in the levels
			The game uses random seed AND the previous level data to create a new level
Could save the level seeds at the start
Also could use that seed to generate contents for chests and drops for monsters when they are created.




THINK ABOUT SECURITY!!!
