	DONE :D :D :D
			
======= Knockback and counter attack ========

Then need to implement knockback (and double blow) with damage and see if it all holds up


====== Level Generation ======

When we do level generation, want to create a series of level seeds and send them to the levels when they are generated
		Also want to save previous monsters (especially uniques), towns, treasures and drops from previous level creation to make sure we have variety in the levels
			The game uses random seed AND the previous level data to create a new level
Could save the level seeds at the start
Also could use that seed to generate contents for chests and drops for monsters when they are created.




THINK ABOUT SECURITY!!!
