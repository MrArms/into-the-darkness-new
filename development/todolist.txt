Check out what is causing that error message!!! SORTED
	Do we want multiple gameEvents working on the same actor at the same time? I'd say no for the moment. 

NEED TO tidy up the status code 
	Probably create a status class (with timer)  DONE
	see below for other tidy ups needed
	Go through all the code and improve it
	
	Then check in
	
	Then add a turnSystem


What to do next?
	Could create a proper turn system for all the actors in the game LEAVE FOR NOW - do we want to use the Rot.js one?	
		Need an intelligent one that moves monsters nearest the player first
	
	
Create statuses and add poison and get it to create a poison GameEvent at the end of the player turn - can we tie it into the ActionGod?	
	
1) Look at how you did status and effects in the 7DRL version and design a new status system
	Effects and statuses the same thing?
	For "1 turn" effects want them to last until the start of the following turn
		Effect is just a flag on a status effect that says that they are reduced at the start and end of the turn
	"normal" status effects last as long as necessary
		CREATE A STATUS CLASS
	Need a preAction function in Actor to deal with the above


2) Think about how the status system works with the ActionGod if at all
	Eventually the renderer will grab the actors status values and can pulse if necessary
	
	When an actor turn ends if it has poison it creates a GameEvent 
		Create an animationGroup class and use it for this and stuff in action God?
		
	What if we want animations for several status effects at the end of the turn?
		Say poison, regen etc. - CREATE THESE TO TEST
		
	COULD MAKE A BUNCH OF ACTIONS and add them in order to the ActionGod
		But is that an action? An action is what an actor does to something
			The status of the actor does the status to the actor (if you see what I mean)
				The damage or health regen are the subsequent effects
				
	ActionGod callback is different depending on whether it is the actual turn or a status effect
		Do we want status effects in there?
		
	After actor turn is completed in ActionGod ---> goes to actor afterTurn() which creates any status effects and then starts the next Action list
		HOW ARE WE GOING TO GET TO THE ACTIONGOD from the actor? Need to think about keeping the actor dumb here
		 Is actor still dumb if it has a link and callback for the ActorGod
			
	Hang on the ActionGod already has a callback to the Game
		It could call GetStatusActions from the actor and then return to the Game itself
			DUNNO you're mixing the Action with the entire TURN for the actor here - it should really deal with the former
			
		The TURN logic is done in the Game class
			
		
	DON'T WANT HARDCODED "poison" eventually *** Do we want a status class? What would it contain? It could have the timer in it and get updated nicely (with flags for 1 turn effects)
		YES WE WANT A STATUS CLASS AT SOME POINT!!!!
	
Need a "currentActor" variable in Game when we do the proper turn manager
	Could have turnManger.getNextActor(); for the next actor

Need to remove poison hard coded damage 
	this._actor.damage(1); - could put it in the status effect perhaps? Tidy it up a bit

	Store "poison" the same place as GameEvents.POISON - perhaps move it to Status.POISON
		SAme with "regen"
		
Clunky the way effects are created and lined up - need a more elegant solution
