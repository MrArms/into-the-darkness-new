Convert the level._actors array into a CellDataObject
	It will be easier to render and compare positions for calculations etc.

I want just the player wandering around the map

	Need to interpret player controls and create action for "move" and the logic behind it


Put the los functions in the map and update the viewed cells in there - send it the position of the player
	Renderer should just grab the map and render it

Put free cell functions (ie positioning monsters etc.) in map? Or level?

(think about saving/loading and recording before doing this)


What is next? The map and moving about? Camera? These two first.
