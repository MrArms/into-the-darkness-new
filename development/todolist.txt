NEED TO FIX THE AI SO IT WORKS!!! DONE

Turn system

Needs to deal with speed (fast, slow, normal)
Player starts each level with 100 timer, monsters start with 10
When the player has the same timing as a monster then move the player first
When more than one monster have the same timer then move the ones nearest the player first


100 timer you get to move
All actors with 100 or more treated the same
move and it goes down to 0
Each "tick" it increases by 10 for normal speed
Slow and it increases by 5
Fast and it increases by 20

Actors need a speed parameter
And a basic AI function (attack the player for now - keep it in the game class for the moment)

COMMIT AND PUSH YOUR CHANGES TO GITHUB!!!!

THINK ABOUT SAVING/LOADING, RECORDING and REPLAYING THE GAME TURNS 

THINK ABOUT SECURITY!!!
