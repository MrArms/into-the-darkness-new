				
GameScreen and Game split up
GameScreen deals with load/save for the game so we can cleanly load/save games whilst playing without problems
It also stores the keymaps for the keyboard controls
It doesn't do much else

Combine contolsLocked and inGame flags - they do the same thing DONE
		
==== Player dying =====

Need to wait until the full turn is over and then test for player death (when removing dead actors probably) DONE
Then set the level to inactive (leave level maybe?) then tell the game screen you've died DONE

======= Knockback and counter attack ========

Then need to implement knockback (and double blow) with damage and see if it all holds up


====== UI Stuff ========

Need an inventory that contains charms - do we want monsters to have player type inventories? Could make it actor based so could add further party members later for another game....
Need an interface for displaying charms and selecting them (and with calls to update the character)

====== Level Generation ======

When we do level generation, want to create a series of level seeds and send them to the levels when they are generated
		Also want to save previous monsters (especially uniques), towns, treasures and drops from previous level creation to make sure we have variety in the levels
			The game uses random seed AND the previous level data to create a new level
Could save the level seeds at the start
Also could use that seed to generate contents for chests and drops for monsters when they are created.
