	DONE :D :D :D
			
======= Knockback and counter attack ========

Counter-attack. DONE
Knockback DONE
Double-blow DONE (ish)

Where should the _meleeAttack function go?

Need to think about when the targets for melee are chosen
At the moment it is done when the actions are created, but it doesn't work as opponents could be knocked back for a second blow and not be hit
	So the action for hit needs a target cell and also an attack pattern that gets resolved as the action happens
	
Also would be good if the AI used _meleeAttack as well as the player - should the AI return something other than an action? Or the action has a target cell instead? <-- BEST IDEA
	Need to test double move for the AI too....

Also need to check double move with movement and any other moves (for player and AI).

Then need to implement knockback (and double blow) with damage and see if it all holds up

Could make "double blow" double action and make it more flexible and interesting - so double healing etc.
	Also probably easier to code as you just store the action and do everything twice (can even move twice)

====== Level Generation ======

When we do level generation, want to create a series of level seeds and send them to the levels when they are generated
		Also want to save previous monsters (especially uniques), towns, treasures and drops from previous level creation to make sure we have variety in the levels
			The game uses random seed AND the previous level data to create a new level
Could save the level seeds at the start
Also could use that seed to generate contents for chests and drops for monsters when they are created.




THINK ABOUT SECURITY!!!
