
NEED TO link up Actor.damageDealt function with the correct game event DONE
Need to test with self sacrifice (need a damage gameEvent for the attacker) DONE
Need to save/load new stats DONE

Bug - use adrenelin + self sacrifice - kill a monster, the next turn you use self sacrifice again (effects should be cleared) FIXED

Check in 

Move _turnActionFinished and _turnFinished from Level to actor (or tidy it up properly)


====== Basic stats ====

Add strength
Magic
Wisdom
Will 

Strength - each point adds one point of damage 

Constitution - difficult one this, perhaps it is only valid for the player since we want to set monster HP explicitly.
	Could just have Constitution = number of HP - yes do this for now KEEPING AS _maxHP FOR THE MOMENT!!!

Calculated stats
	
NEED TO ADD ALL NEW STATS TO THE LOAD/SAVE STUFF ***********

Defence

Picking stuff up takes a turn? LEAVE FOR THE MOMENT


Things we need before we have a game

-- Loads more charm types
-- Loads more monster types
