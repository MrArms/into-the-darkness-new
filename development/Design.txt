Inventory

Normal inventory stuff - items and equipment (can use consumbales)
Charms - separate and have a maximum amount you can use


Skill points can be re-assigned? Not sure might be interesting.
Or perhaps skills are reliant on equipment.
Mind you I like the idea of a skill system with points that you assign. Let's you build up a character gradually. Spells/prayers etc.
Could avoid the class/race stuff at the start perhaps....
