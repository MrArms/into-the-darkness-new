Inventory

Normal inventory stuff - items and equipment (can use consumbales)
Charms - separate and have a maximum amount you can use

Xp gained is like in Sil and you have Xp to next card too (granted by the gods) - so killing the same monsters over and over gets you less cards?
Although the monsters may drop some too


Skill points can be re-assigned? Not sure might be interesting.
Or perhaps skills are reliant on equipment.
Mind you I like the idea of a skill system with points that you assign. Let's you build up a character gradually. Spells/prayers etc.
Could avoid the class/race stuff at the start perhaps....

Could AVOID consumables and use cards cleverly to restore SP and HP!!!! 
Can use cards to boost attacks or heal yourself instead perhaps or both with certain combos... could combine with actions you can perform (abilities, prayers etc.)

Card conbinations for restoring lost values - maybe the "attack" and "defence" values can be used as a "force" that can be used in other ways - healing, restoring etc.
	Can boost the cards for attack or something else
